- SSL/TLS 
    - Normally, an SSL/TLS certificate is generated to all of domains and subdomains of a website. this means that finding the checksum of a SSL/TLS certificate and finding its correspondance in http://crt.sh/ and https://ui.ctsearch.entrust.com/ui/ctsearchui can potentialy give some subdomains of a website

- google
    - Using google with the syntax : site:*.domain can result in listing subdomains of the domain. To exclude the root domain, 
    - site:*.<DOMAIN> -site:www.<DOMAIN>

- brute force
    - sometimes, bruteforcing with a wordlist is the solution.
