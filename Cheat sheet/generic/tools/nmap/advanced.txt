- null scan : -sN
    - do not send any flag
        - do not receive response : open|filtered port
        - receive RST flag : closed port
    - need root privilege
    - used to trick a stateless firewall(firewall that check a SYN flag)
- FIN scan : -sF
    - send a TCP FIN
    - work like null scan
- xmas scan : -sX
    - send URG, PSH, FIN simultaneously.
    - work like null scan
- ack scan : -sA
    - useful to determine the rule of the firewall
- window scan : -sW
    - most likely the same as ack scan
- custom scan : --scanflags [FLAGS]
    - FLAGS can be any flag with no separator:
        - ex : for SYN and FIN: 
            --scanflags SYNFIN
- spoofed ip : -S SPOOFED_IP
    - send a request with a SPOOFED_IP and the response will be send to the SPOOFED_IP
    - in real world use this with -e and -Pn
        - e : explicitely give the interface
        - Pn : disable ping scan
- spoofed mac : -spoof-mac SPOOFED_MAC
    - use the same behavior as spoofed ip but with mac address
    - only if in the same subnet
- decoy : -D [MANY_RANDOM_IP],MY_IP
    - send the result to many other destination so the network won't really know who is scanning the network
- fragment ip data: -f
    - the IP data is fragmented to 8 bytes
    - using -ff instead of -f will divide the IP data to 16 bytes
- zombie scan : -sI ZOMBIE_IP
    - work like the scan is comming from the ZOMBIE_IP
